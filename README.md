PacMan-DinoStyle
================

Author: Danielle Fudger



Summary
================
This is a singleplayer PacMan game with a dinosaur twist. The goal of the game is to get your character, Tony the Triceratops to eat all of the tasty pineapples to keep his evergy up. But there are meteors all around the land that will destroy you if you hit eachother. You must eat all of the pineapples to win the game, and not get hit by any of the meteors or the game is over. To move Tony the Triceratops, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move him left, right, up and down around the game board. There are four meteors in this game. Three were mandatory, but with the size of the game board, it made more sense to have four meteors so it was a fair challenge. The game keeps track of your current score based on the number of food eaten. The score is based on if you have food left or you don’t. When you have no more food, you win!
